# SAME70-RTOS-HCSR04
This project implements a distance measurement system using an HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor and displays the distance on a 128x32 OLED display using a SAME70-XPLD microcontroller.

The system works by triggering the ultrasonic sensor with a 10 Âµs pulse and measuring the duration of the returned echo signal. The duration is then converted to distance using the speed of sound. The measured distance and a chart of the distance over time is then displayed on the OLED display.

The code is written in C language and uses the Atmel Software Framework (ASF) library for the SAME70-XPLD microcontroller. It also uses the FreeRTOS library for task scheduling and synchronization.
